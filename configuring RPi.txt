Steps to configure Raspberry Pi.

Using the PL011 UART port

For Raspbian Linux releases after 18th March 2016 there is a device tree file called 
pi3-miniuart-bt which makes the Raspberry Pi disable the Bluetooth module and map pl011 UART on pins 14 and 15 as before.

Step 1 - Login via terminal or desktop and shell

Step 2 - Add device tree to /boot/config.txt to disable the bluetooth module.
         sudo nano /boot/config.txt

         Add at the end of the file
         dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt

Step 3 - Exit the editor saving your changes and then:
         sudo reboot

Disabling the Serial Console

The serial console on Raspberry Pi Stretch is enabled by default.
To use the UART port with serial devices you will need to disable the console.


Step 1 - To disable the serial console, you need to edit the /boot/cmdline.txt file

         sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Step 2 - Find the following text and remove it:

         console=serial0,115200

Step 3 - Exit the editor saving your changes and then:

sudo reboot

With the serial console disabled you can now access the UART serial port at /dev/ttyAMA0.
